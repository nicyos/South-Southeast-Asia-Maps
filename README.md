# Sri Lanka Mapping Projects

This is the repository for my mapping projects related to Sri Lanka and links from my blog site. Included here are codes and final products. The codes are available in both of python format and as jupyter notebooks saved in .html format. For the .html files, simply git pull or download and open them with Firefox or Chrome. Please contact me if you have questions. 

Happy mapping/plotting!
